Today we're here to explore and celebrate [OpenAI's DevDay Announcements](https://openai.com/devday/), together.

We know this is a relatively short time to hack, and your demos don't need to be polished. 

You can even show off a potential use case in the [Realtime Console App](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console).

## Schedule

```
5:45 PM - Doors open & snacks
6:00 PM - Lightning talks
6:15 PM - Start hacking
8:30 PM - Demos & presentations to pick winners
```
