# AI Hacknight - San Francisco - 10/02


Welcome to AI Hacknight

**[shrty.dev/hack-ai](https://shrty.dev/hack-ai)**


Today we're here to explore and celebrate [OpenAI's DevDay Announcements](https://openai.com/devday/), together.

We know this is a relatively short time to hack, and your demos don't need to be polished. 

You can even show off a potential use case in the [Realtime Console App](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console).
