Today we're here to create small projects that use genAI

We know this is a relatively short time to hack, and if you want to present, you won't need to prepared a polished demo. 

## Schedule

```
5:45 PM - Doors open & snacks
6:00 PM - Lightning talks
6:15 PM - Start hacking
8:30 PM - Demos & presentations to pick winners
```

## Project Tracks
Ideally your project matches one of the following projec tracks.
It's totally optional, you can just hack on whatever you want:
- Best Use of Toolhouse.ai platform
- Best Use of Cloudflare services
- Most likely to be a business
